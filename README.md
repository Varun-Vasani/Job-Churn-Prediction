# Job-Churn-Prediction
A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science is looking to hire data scientists from a pool of candidates who have successfully completed various training courses conducted by the company. Many people sign up for these training programs, but the company wants to identify which candidates are likely to stay with the company after training versus those who are seeking new job opportunities. This insight can help the company reduce recruitment costs, improve the quality of training, and better plan course offerings. The dataset includes information about candidates' demographics, education, and work experience obtained from their signup and enrollment forms.

This project aims to predict employee job churn using the available data to determine which candidates are likely to leave the company. By building predictive models using the candidates' credentials, demographics, and experience, the goal is to assess the probability that a candidate will either stay with the company or seek new employment.
